## About

> I've been programming PHP for over a decade. The `date()` function has gone largely unchanged this entire time, yet I
can *never* remember all the various formatting characters.
>
>I created this cheat sheet to combine documentation from the PHP Manual with handy reference tables and live example output.
>
>I've provided a public repository of the source code for educational purposes â€“ and because I love open-source. A
hosted version of this guide is available on my website: https://jasongardner.co/php-date-cheat-sheet/
